Documenting the Cleaned Excel Function file 2-4 in my learning journey with The Incubator Hub
## Introduction:
Welcome to my data journey! My name is Oki Oluwatobi, and I'm an HR professional with a solid foundation in customer satisfaction, quality control, and project management. I've decided to pivot into the world of data because I believe data can unlock new insights, improve decision-making, and create a real impact in any field.

As someone with a background in human resources and customer relations, I’ve seen firsthand how data can help understand employee satisfaction, track performance, and even predict trends that can shape a better workplace. My goal is to harness the power of data to drive strategic decisions that align with both business objectives and employee well-being. Ultimately, I’m excited to develop the technical skills and analytical mindset necessary to make data-driven contributions in HR and beyond. 

### Goals:
#### In my journey, I aim to:

Build a strong foundation in data analysis tools like Python, SQL, and data visualization.
Apply data analysis to HR and customer satisfaction projects, exploring patterns in employee performance, customer feedback, and process improvements.
Expand into machine learning for predictive insights that can support HR strategies, such as employee retention models or talent acquisition analytics.
Share my progress and projects here on GitHub, both to track my growth and to help others who might be interested in transitioning into data roles.
Thank you for stopping by, and I look forward to connecting with others who share a passion for data!
